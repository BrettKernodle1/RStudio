#1.1 Types of Variables
#9-14-21

#This lesson is explaining the 5 main data types in R. They can also be called the atomic data types


#integer
x <- 2L # The <- is the assignment operator in R. It is assigning the value of 2 to X
      #If we do not insert a "L" after the integer variable than it will store it as a double by default. The "L" tells R to store it as a integer.
typeof(x)   #typeof() checks the type of variable. In this case it was an integer

#double
y <- 2.5
typeof(y)

#complex
z <- 3 + 2i
typeof(z)

#character
a <- "h"
typeof(a)

#logical 
q1 <- T
typeof(q1)
q2 <- FALSE
typeof(q2)
